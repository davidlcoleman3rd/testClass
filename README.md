**Test Class**

A primitive class designed to allow for testing code for undesired results.  Allows the user to create "Test" objects, store an integer value within them, print this value, and do basic artihmetic operations and logical operations - This allows the user to extend the functionality to loops, arithmetic functions, etc.

This class structure will be expanded upon and additonal functionality will be added.

~~

*Version 0.1*
  - Created the project
  - Added the Input function to take in a value as a parameter and store it in the member variable
  - Added the Print function to print the member variable
  - Added the InputPrint function to perform both tasks and save time
  - Added the Output function to return the member variable
  - Added the overloaded +, -, and = operations to allows for direct member arithmetic without needing to
    constantly pass members around
  - Added a default constructor that sets the member variable to 0, a parameterized constructor that sets the
    member variable to the parameter, and a copy constructor that sets the member variable to the value of the
    parameterized object
  - Added a primitive demonstration file to show some of the capabilities of the class at a barebones level
